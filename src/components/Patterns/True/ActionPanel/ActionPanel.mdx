# Introducing the Action Panel

We've created the Action Panel to provide a consistent user experience for repeated
actions. At it's heart it's a slide out Drawer with a collection of standard MudBlazor
components.

<Canvas of={ReportStories.Design} />
<br />
## How we invoke the Action Panel

To maintain consistency throughout we have created a re-usable header component
that can be inserted onto every page.

View the True Header component [here](?path=/docs/design-system-components-true-page-header--docs)

Within this component we define an action area where various CTA Buttons can be placed.
For consistency Action Panel buttons are styled in "outlined" with a preceding icon. See the **"Download Report"** button in the example below.

See below the markup for the TruePageHeader component:

<Canvas of={PageHeaderStories.ForBillValidation} />
<br />
## Action Panel Anatomy

The Action Panel is structure as follows:

```js
<MudDrawerRight>
  <MudDrawerContent>
    <MudGrid>
      // The Header is always present
      <ActionPanelHeader title="Download report" />
      // Content is always placed between GridItemDrawer
      <GridItemDrawer>(-- Content--)</GridItemDrawer>
    </MudGrid>
  </MudDrawerContent>
</MudDrawerRight>
```

### MudDrawer

MudDrawerRight is a decorator for MudDrawer with the following properties:

```c
// MudBlazor
<MudDrawer @bind-Open="@openRight" Anchor="Anchor.Right" {other props} >
    // Content
</MudDrawer>
```

<br />
### Action Panel Header

<Canvas of={ActionHeaderStories.Header} />

This Pattern uses the MudDrawerHeader component as a base, we have a made a reusable decorator TrueDrawerHeader that injects it with certain properties.

Here's how the component is structured:

```js
<>
  <TrueDrawerHeader classes="border-l-8 mud-border-primary align-center justify-space-between">
    <MudTypography typo="h6" classes="mud-primary-text">
      // Panel Title
    </MudTypography>
    <MudIconButton>(-- close icon --)</MudIconButton>
  </TrueDrawerHeader>
  <MudItem classes="mud-grid-item-xs-12">
    <MudDivider />
  </MudItem>
</>
```

Notice the TrueDrawerHeader component, this is a decorator wrapping around MudDrawerHeader.
Here is how it looks under the hood:

```js
// True Draw header
<MudDrawerHeader classes={"mud-grid-item-xs-12 pl-4 pr-2 pt-2 pb-2"}>
  {content}
</MudDrawerHeader>
```

<br />
### Action Panel Body

We use the **_TrueItemDrawer_** decorator to arrange content in the body of the action Panel.

```js
<TrueItemDrawer>{content}</TrueItemDrawer>
```

Here's how that looks under the hood:

```js
// React
<MudItem classes="mud-grid-item-xs-12 pl-6 pr-6 pt-8 pb-1">{content}</MudItem>
```

> **NOTE** The Action Panel is for user actions that interact with the application.
