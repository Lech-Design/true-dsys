# True Dashboard

The True dashboard is a reusable page pattern that divides the content
into sections with single or multiple widgets.

<br />

## How we construct the Dashboard

The Dashboard is constructed using the Primary True layout (TrueLayoutPrimary), this features a left draw
containing the main Nav which automatically shrinks at smaller breakpoints.

We then use the True Page Normal pattern which sets a max width and wraps all the page
content in a flex grid with even spacing.

Now we can compose the Dashboard page using Dashboard sections and the Dashboard widget pattern.

Below is a representation of the pattern hierarchy:

```js
<TrueLayoutPrimary>
  <TruePageNormal>
    <TrueDashPage>
      <TrueDashSection>
        <TrueWidget>
```

See [here](?path=/docs/patterns-layout-pages-docs--docs) for more details on how to compose Layouts and Pages

<br />

### True Layout Primary

See [here](?path=/docs/patterns-layout-pages-layout-primary--docs) for design and specifications of this pattern.

We have designed this as shared pattern so that it can be reused in other sections and pages within the True app.

<br />

### True Page Normal

This pattern is composed with the MudContainer component, this allows us to define a max width for our main content
For this specific 'Normal' configuration we use the following container CSS class:

> mud-container-maxwidth-lg

This sets a max width of 1280px on the container.

We also apply a MudGrid component with 0 spacing but with a grid gap of 12 to evenly space sections within the page.

See [here](?path=/docs/patterns-layout-pages-page-templates-normal--docs) for design and specifications of this pattern.

<br />

### True Dash Page

Here is where we compose the Dashboard page.

We divide the page using the TrueDashSection component. This provides an optional Title and description for each section.
Next we place the TrueWidget component to compose our individual dashboard widgets. This is wrapped in a MudItem
component which can be styled with utility classes to define it's size in the grid.
