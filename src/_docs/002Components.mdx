# Making sense of components

<br />
Components can take different shapes and sizes and levels of complexity.

For the True Design system we define following terminology:

<br />
### Components

This refers to the standard components provided by MudBlazor, all are prefixed with the word **"Mud"**.

```js
<MudGrid />
```

<br />
### Decorators

These are wrappers that pre-populate existing MudBlazor components, they contain no extra logic, always prefixed with the word **True**.

```js
<TrueDrawerHeader />
```

<br />
