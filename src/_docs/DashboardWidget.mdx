# True Widget

The Dashboard widget is the main building block for composing Dashboard type pages.
It is a shared component that can be reused in other pages throughout the True app.
At it's heart is a MudPaper component with some defined properties for Elevation, outlines and padding.

<div style={{ margin: "2rem" }}>
  <TrueWidget />
</div>

The Widget contains a header area to include and title and interactive actions, below this you are free
to define the content you wish to include, for the examples in these docs we show some simple
chart illustrations but these are not final designs.

Here is how the TrueDashWidget component is constructed:

```csharp
<MudPaper Outlined="true" Class="px-8 py-6">
    <MudGrid Spacing="0">
        <!-- Content goes here -->
        @ChildContent
    </MudGrid>
</MudPaper>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment ChildContent {get; set;}
}
```

<br />

## True Widget Header

The Widget Header is composed of a MudGrid component which separates the Title text from any interactive actions.
In the example below @ChildContent provides composition for optional interactive actions.

Here is how the True Widget header is constructed:

```csharp
<MudItem Class="mud-grid-item-xs-12">
    <MudGrid Spacing="0" Class="pa-0 ma-0 pb-10 justify-space-between align-center">
        <MudText Typo="Typo.h5" Class="grey-text text-darken-1">
            @Title
        </MudText>
        @ChildContent
    </MudGrid>
</MudItem>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string Title {get; set;} = "Consumption";

    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment ChildContent {get; set;}
}
```

## Putting it all together

To compose widgets with an included header see the TrueDashPage pattern.
