# Downloading a report

We've created a reporting tool which can be reused between different app features.
We'll go into more detail on how we compose the reporting tool, but the core component
is what we call the Action Panel.

<br />

## Introducing the Action Panel

We've created the Action Panel to provide a consistent user experience for repeated actions.
At it's heart it's a slide out Drawer with a collection of standard MudBlazor components.

<Canvas of={ReportStories.ReportingTool} />

<br />
## How we invoke the Action Panel

To maintain consistency throughout we have created a re-usable header component
that can be inserted onto every page.

View the True Header component [here](?path=/docs/design-system-components-true-page-header--docs)

Within this component we define an action area where various CTA Buttons can be placed.

For consistency Action Panel buttons are styled in "outlined" with a preceding icon.

See below the markup for the TruePageHeader component:

<Canvas of={PageHeaderStories.ForBillValidation} />
